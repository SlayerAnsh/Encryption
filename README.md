# ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
This is a simple example of cipher algorithm which uses **Binary Tree** for second level encryption.

### Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries.
In simple language, **Cryptography** is modifying your data in such a way that only you and the receiver know the real data while any other intermediate person (hacker, request, etc) cannot interpret the meaning of modified data.
Cryptography mainly include two steps [**ENCRYPTION**](#encryption) and [**DECRYPTION**](#decryption).
