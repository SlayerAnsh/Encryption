# ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
This is a simple example of cipher algorithm which uses **Binary Tree** for second level encryption.

### Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries.
In simple language, **Cryptography** is modifying your data in such a way that only you and the receiver know the real data while any other intermediate person (hacker, request, etc) cannot interpret the meaning of modified data.
Cryptography mainly include two steps [**ENCRYPTION**](#encryption) and [**DECRYPTION**](#decryption).

### ENCRYPTION

### DECRYPTION

### EXECUTION OF THE CODE
Note : Relative links are used, therefore keep all files in same folder.
1. Change the message in main.cpp
2. open cmd in current directory
3. run execute `C:\Folder\folder execute`

If you want to edit the code, don't forget to go through all the header files and during execution link the object files properly.

Follow these steps if you want to manually link files :
1. open cmd and run `g++ -c *.cpp`
2. After completion without error, run `g++ -o main *.o`
3. Now for execution, run `main`

Note: You have to Link files every time you modify.

For Linux bases system, use `make` to automate the linking process.
